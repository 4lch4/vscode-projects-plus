Now:
  ☐ Add support for multi-root
  ☐ Add a `projects.favorites` view

Next:
  ☐ Fix active project showed on top of the others (distracting)(test by searching for "vscode-")

Future:
  ☐ Show an indeterminate progressbar when refreshing
  ☐ Add support for nested groups switching even if groups' names aren't unique

Maybe:
  ☐ Add configurable shortcuts for each project
  ☐ Add a `Project: Move` command (Subset of Save)
  ☐ Add a `Project: Edit` command (Just an alias for Save)
  ☐ Make configPath point to the default user settings folder (can be synced with the Sync extension) in a backward compatible manner
  ☐ Add a `projects.recents` view
